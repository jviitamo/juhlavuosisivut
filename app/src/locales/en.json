The diversity of career paths will come together under the theme Navigating Sustainable & Meaningful Careers. What, how and why sustainable and meaningful careers are about more than wellbeing, and how it is about the larger societal issue at the heart of our competencies. We believe that the multidisciplinary and human-centred digital literacy represented by Info is largely about navigating one's competencies, career and wellbeing in an uncertain and changing world.",
